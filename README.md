# YYC_ripper

Extract sprites from games made with GMS.
Should work for .exe files aswell as .win files.

Of course you only use this on your own games.

## How to use
1. Put the yyc_ripper.exe into the directory containing the file you want to process.
2. Start yyc_ripper and input the filename (ex: data.win)
3. Hope it doesn't crash due to a stackoverflow
4. Enjoy
