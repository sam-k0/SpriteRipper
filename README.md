# YYC_ripper

Extract sprites from games made with GMS.
Should work for .exe files aswell as .win files.

Of course you only use this on your own games.

If windows says its malware, download an older release. Idk what I did wrong that it now triggers defender.
## How to use
1. Drag and drop the .win file onto the yyc_ripper.exe
2. PNG files will now be stored in the directory of the .win file
